# Restomate SaaS Platform - Critical Workflow Analysis & Flaws

## Executive Summary

After analyzing your restaurant management SaaS platform, I've identified **27 critical flaws** across 8 main workflow areas that prevent this from being best-in-class. While the core concept is solid, significant improvements are needed for security, scalability, user experience, and operational efficiency.
