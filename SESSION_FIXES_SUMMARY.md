# Session Logic Fixes - Comprehensive Solution

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Session Status Visibility Issue**
**Problem**: Staff couldn't see customers who scanned QR codes but hadn't ordered yet
**Solution**:
- Updated Tables page to show both `active` AND `waiting` sessions
- Added clear status indicators: "Active (Ordered)" vs "Waiting (Browsing)"
- Added session duration badges to track how long customers have been at table

### 2. **Table Occupancy Logic Inconsistency**
**Problem**: Tables showed incorrect occupancy status
**Solutions**:
- Fixed `syncTableOccupancy()` to consider both `active` AND `waiting` sessions as occupied
- Tables are now marked as occupied immediately when QR is scanned (session created)
- Fixed all API calls to fetch both session types

### 3. **No Automatic Session Cleanup**
**Problem**: Abandoned sessions (people who scan but leave) were never cleaned up
**Solutions**:
- Added automatic cleanup every 10 minutes via server startup
- Sessions that are `waiting` for 30+ minutes with no orders get marked as `abandoned`
- Tables are automatically freed when sessions are abandoned

### 4. **Staff Action Gaps**
**Problem**: No way for staff to identify and help browsing customers
**Solutions**:
- Added "At Risk" warning badges for sessions waiting 20+ minutes
- Added "Assist Browsing" button for waiting sessions
- Bills button is disabled for waiting sessions (can't bill someone who hasn't ordered)

## Technical Changes Made

### Server-Side Changes:
1. **storage.ts**: Updated `syncTableOccupancy()` to include waiting sessions
2. **routes.ts**: Mark table as occupied immediately when session is created
3. **index.ts**: Added periodic cleanup every 10 minutes

### Client-Side Changes:
1. **tables.tsx**: 
   - Show both active and waiting sessions
   - Added session duration display
   - Added risk indicators
   - Added status-specific action buttons
   - Improved status colors and text

## Session Lifecycle Now:
1. **QR Scan** → Session created as `waiting` → Table marked `occupied`
2. **First Order** → Session becomes `active` → Orders can be placed
3. **Bill Requested** → Session status can become `requesting_bill`
4. **All Bills Paid** → Session becomes `completed` → Table marked `free`
5. **Abandoned** → After 30 min waiting with no orders → Table marked `free`

## Benefits:
- ✅ Staff can see all customers at tables (both browsing and ordering)
- ✅ Clear visual indicators of session status and duration
- ✅ Automatic cleanup prevents ghost sessions
- ✅ Table occupancy is always accurate
- ✅ Staff get actionable prompts for customer service
- ✅ System self-maintains without manual intervention

## QR Code Workflow Unchanged:
- Customers still scan QR codes the same way
- Session creation works exactly as before
- Order placement works exactly as before
- The fixes are entirely on the backend logic and staff visibility
